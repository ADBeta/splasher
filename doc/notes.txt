The Raspberry Pi 1, using the pigpio C GPIO library, the max pulse speed is
around 2.5MHz. This is slow enough to let a 0 delay take over

the pigpio library does not handle gpioDelay(0), this still waits for 1us or
more

the lowest delay counts permitted in the library is 1 microseconds, meaning 1MHz
if the maximum allowable (if nothing else slowed down the data stream)
